Mix well and then set aside.Take the cooking spray and spray the entire inside portion of the slow cooker AND also the wings. (Spraying the wings before you grill, bake, or cook chicken keeps the flavor and makes them super juicy. TRUST ME.)Take the wings and add them into the mixing bowl with your spices and toss to get a good even coat over the wings.Place in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. After 4hours, remove carefully and place on a prepared cookie sheet. Place in the oven under broiler setting for 4-6 minutes, allowing the wings to get a little crisp.Serve immediately with a little blue cheese dressing and celery.",

			"instructions": "Preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Place a large heavy bottomed pot on the stove top (like a Le Creuset pot).\nOver medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp. Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels. Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce. Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.\nDry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel. The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry. This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.\nCut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections. Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor. Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.\nOver medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear. Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly. You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well. You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage. The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.\nPlace the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.\nAfter all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit. Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.\nThen over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes. Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.\nDeglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon. As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper. Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot. Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.\nThen place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed. Don't peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.\nAfter 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid. Prepare for a steam facial! Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl. Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone. Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top. Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it. Remove as much as you can. Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.\nRemember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!! Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third. This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point. Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.\nAdd the Beef Short Ribs back to the pot of reduced Sauce and remove from the heat. Coat the Short Ribs in the Sauce well. Serve Immediately over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes or Polenta.",

Skim as much fat as you can.\nIn a small bowl, stir together cornstarch and 1 tbs. of water till completely smooth.\nPour the cornstarch mixture into the bowl of sauce and stir to combine.\nReduce the sauce quickly in a saucepan on the stovetop by simmering it to 10 minutes.\nPour the sauce over the brisket and serve.\nThe leftovers make great BBQ sandwiches.\nIf you like crockpot food, be sure to check out some of my favorite recipes at www.mealdiva.com",

			"instructions": "1. In a small bowl, mix together water, yogurt, 1/4 c. oil and egg yolk. In the workbowl of a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar and yeast to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the liquid ingredients to the flour. Process until combined. Let mixture rest for 10 minutes.\n2. Add salt and process another 30-60 seconds. It will form a sticky dough that should clear the sides of the food processor workbowl.\n3. Scrape dough out onto a floured worksurface and knead just until smooth, about a minute. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl (large). Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate 16-24 hours.\n4.After the dough has rested, turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide dough into 4 pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest 15-20 minutes.\n5. Meanwhile melt the butter in a small saucepan, then add the garlic. Set aside.\n6. Roll the first piece of dough out into a 9 inch round. Using a fork, poke the dough all over, 20-25 times. Lightly mist the top side with water.\n6. Heat the remaining oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer. Wipe the oil out of the skillet with paper towels, then add the rolled out dough, sprayed side down and spray the other side lightly. Cover skillet and cook until spotty brown underneath, 2-4 minutes (poke any large bubbles that form). Flip naan, cook, covered, another 2-3 minutes until browned.

Rinse pieces under cold water and set to dry for at least 10 minutes. In a heavy pot such as a dutch oven, pour in canola or peanut oil to a depth of 3 inches. Heat over medium-high for about 15 minutes or until ready for frying.\n2. In the meantime, combine sauce ingredients of soy, vinegar, sugar, honey, ketchup, sesame oil, Thai chili peppers, and the seasoning in a small sauce pan. Boil until sauce slightly thickens and then set at low heat. Adjust the spiciness/sweetness of the sauce by adding more minced red peppers and/or sugar, continuously tasting for desired result.\n3. In a large mixing bowl, mix 1 cup cornstarch and salt and pepper. Individually coat each chicken wing pieces with the cornstarch and set aside.\n4. In another bowl, whisk the remaining cornstarch and water together to make a runny, liquidy batter. Add each chicken wing one at a time and coat well. Shake off excess batter and fry the chicken in batches for about 10~13 minutes, or until golden brown, then drain on paper towels. Do not overcrowd the pan when frying each batch.\n5. Flavor the wings with a brush or by tossing them all together in a mixing bowl. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with sesame seeds. Enjoy and eat while hot!",
